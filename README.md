# SQL
# PROJECT 1 :- Swiggy Analysis
I analyzed Swiggy data using SQL. I looked at things like orders, restaurants, and customer behavior. It helped understand how people use Swiggy, which can help improve the service and make better decisions for the business.

# PROJECT 2 :- Movie Analysis 
I analyzed a dataset of movies using SQL, digging into genres and movie titles. I learned about different types of movies and how they're labeled. This helped me understand the movie world better and improved my SQL and data analysis abilities.
